These configs are for using 0.040" thick PEI adhered to the glass bed of a begonia LulzBot Mini prototype. These are still test configs, so please let me know what works and what doesn't.

There are two basic methods for getting the part off, one (cooldown) involves cooling the bed down completely then using canned air of a clam knife to knock the part loose. The other involves the user removing the part early in the cooldown of the bed; so you don't have to babysit the print, the "keephot" configs will keep the bed at printing temperature until you actively turn it off in pronterface.

After some more testing we should have one set of config's that work well.
