medium PLA configuration notes:

This configuration is a good middle-of-the-road default for when you want a nice looking print that doesn't take forever to print. The infill is set to 30%, which is a good default for most parts that require moderate strength. If you'd like a stronger part, simply change the infill density setting under print settings in slic3r (recommended maximum is 85% to maintain a good surface finish). This print uses a 0.22mm layer thickness, which is very well suited to the 0.35mm nozzle. However if you do wish to go to a larger or smaller layer thickness, simply change the layer height setting in print settings (0.75 microns is the recommended minimum, .28mm the recommended maximum).

PLA needs more time to cool than ABS, so the faster you go and the hotter your nozzle, the more imperative it is that you use a fan to cool the extrusion after it hits the previous layer. we highly recommend using a fan for any prints that have overhangs or bridges.
